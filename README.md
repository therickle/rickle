# Rickle

## Welcome to Rickle. 

> Our core mission is a community built to bring decentralized finance to the common person.

So, what does that mean? Well to start Rickle, is a token on the ethereum network that has been bridged to Gnosis(xDai), Polygon(Matic), Binance Smart Chain(BSC/BNB), and Harmony One. We chose Ethereum because at it was
the most popular smart contract chain at the time of creating the contract. However, we knew when we created the contract 
we are not limited to one network. With our understanding of technology we knew some of what was possible.

In September of 2021, Mike Estrada and a few other people got together to form the Rickle team, and we begun building what is known as today's Rickle community. You can join us today on discord.gg/rickletoken. Check out our website, and add the Rickle to your wallet. [Rickle Token](https://rickletoken.com) [The Rickle](https://therickle.com) 

Come join us and help built better tools for our decentralized financial future.
