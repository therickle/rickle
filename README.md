# Rickle

## Welcome to Rickle. 

> Our core mission is a community built to bring decentralized finance to the common person.

So, what does that mean? Well to start Rickle, is a token on the ethereum network. We chose Ethereum because it is
the most popular smart contract chain at the time of creating the contract. However, we knew when we created the contract 
we are not limited to one network. With our understanding of technology we knew some of what was possible.

In September of 2021, Mike Estrada and a few other people got together to form the Rickle team, and we begun building what is known as 
today's Rickle community. You can join us today on discord.gg/rickletoken. Check out our website, and add the Rickle to your wallet. [Rickle](https://therickle.com)

We have established ourselves on the following exchanges.

### Tipping Winston ###
The following commands can be used to tip Winston.

> By adding keywords to your tips from tipcc to Winston you can perform the following actions. 

_ stake _

Usage : 
`$tip @Winston [amount] [coin] stake`

With this feature we have enabled the ability to stake your tokens/coins for community funded rewards. 
These rewards are based on a few factors. The first factor is if a pool is setup for a coin. If there is no pool there is no payouts.
The next is how much is in the pool. This amount is divided by 365 for each day of the year, this gives the daily payout amount. 
We then again, divide that by 24 for each hour of the day. Since payout's happen hourly, currently. This will be changed to daily once we go live.
From there the amount of payout is determined by how much everyone has staked. You get a reward based on the percentage of the total staked coin.

Usage : 
`!stake [*coin]`
See what balance and what is pending vestment and vested fully.

_ faucet _

Usage : 
`$tip @Winston [amount] [coin] faucet`

The faucets are community funded. We use 50 Rickle each time a member purchases a membership to add to the faucet. There are faucets for every token/coin
on Winston. It cost nothing to donate to the faucet or use the Rickle faucet. Members have access to all of the available faucets 1 after every 2 hours, and non-members 
can utilize it once after every 6 hours. Members receive 1/100 of the faucet drop amount each time, and none members receive 1/10000.

_ burn _

Usage : 
`$tip @Winston [amount] [coin] burn`

We beleive in value in our community and one way to help keep value in a coin is to burn it's supply, Winston will be a source to burn over 400 types of crypto.
We have a simple solution to the burn process, Our first priority with Winston was to reduce fees involved in blockchain trading.
Well we did that, now we want to make it easier to increase value in projects as not all projects have the ability to burn their tokens.
Winston gives them an option, With Winston being a Trust company you can trust we will never use the burned funds for anything more than fees we incure from networks or 
we will actually send them to known, published burn addressed. If a project doesn't have a burn address yet, Winston is going to create contract's
that you can send any coin to this will be on as many networks as we can over time to create burn contracts. Until and address or contract is setup, Winston will use the funds
for fee's or hold them until they can be burned to a network address.
