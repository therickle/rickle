Ethereum is a software running on a network of computers that ensures that 
data and small computer programs called smart contracts are replicated and 
processed on all the computers on the network, without a central coordinator. 
Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has a blockchain, which contains blocks of data (that is, 
transacঞons and smart contracts). The blocks are created or mined by some 
parঞcipants and distributed to other parঞcipants who validate them. Blocks 
form a chain by referring to the hash or fingerprint of the previous block. Rickle 
chose chose Ethereum or its leading blockchain and distributed ledger technology to 
permit Rickle to solidify its network position in the competitive cryptocurrency 
world.
